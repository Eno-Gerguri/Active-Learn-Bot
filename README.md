## How to Install

1. Use the command `git clone https://github.com/Eno-Gerguri/Active-Learn-Bot.git` in order to clone this project
2. Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to get the dependencies of the project

## How to Edit for your Account

1. Go into the `src` folder
2. Open `main.py` 
3. Change the `username` and `password` variable to your Active Learn username and password
4. Change the `task` variable to the link to your task page

## How to Use

Once you have configured the script perform the following steps:

1. Type the command `python3 main.py` in the `src` folder in order to start the program and wait for the task list to appear in the newly made chrome tab
2. Choose and start a "Vocabulary Learn" task click the "next" button on the instructions screen
3. If the bot starts typing that means it is successful and is working if it not: click the "X" button to "Pause your progress" and then re-click into the task and the bot will definitely work this time
4. Once the "Vocabulary Learn" task is finished (estimated 8 seconds) press "Submit progress and exit"
5. The next task you click must be the "Vocabulary Test" task for the "Vocabulary Learn" task which the bot just finished. As soon as you click the "Vocabulary Test" task it will be quickly automatically finished
6. Repeat steps 2-5 as many times as you want

## Tips

When you are running the program you can only choose tasks which are currently paused or have not been started yet. If you want to redo a task you have already done go to your account and re-try the task you have completed and then pause and exit as soon as you do so the bot can do it for you.
